# Statbotics CSVs

This repository serves as data archive for Statbotics.io and is an ideal starting point for data-science projects leveraging the data collection.

The `elo` folder includes a backup of Caleb Sykes' Elo model predictions from 2002 - 2022. The `v1` folder includes Elo and OPR data displayed on Statbotics prior to 2023. The `v2` folder includes EPA data displayed on Statbotics from 2023 onwards. Both the `v1` and `v2` folders include seven tables: Years, Teams, TeamYears, Events, TeamEvents, Matches, and TeamMatches. The column names should be self-explanatory, but please feel free to create an issue if you have questions or concerns. Thanks!
